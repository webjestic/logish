# logish

Shamelessly *derived & inspired from* the concepts and code from [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug), [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) and [log4js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/log4js).

**Logish** is designed to for centralized logging and debugging, with simplicity in mind.
